With javacv it's easier to move facerec project, at least it doesn't require
ndk build to implement c++ code (as in the facedetect sample and many ndk-dependent opencv samples
where one had to add the ndk directory's path as variable to Preferences / C/C++ / Build / Environment 
and name it 'NDKROOT').

To start a new facerecognition based project based on the opencv sample,
you only need to:

1. (!) copy the whole content of the 'libs' folder (and add the jars to the build path):
	- javacv.jar
	- javacpp.jar
	- armeabi-v7a folder containing all the pre-generated javacv/cpp .so methods


2. add opencv library in Properties / Android etc


And the the usual stuff:

3. add other usual dependencies eg. appcompat_v7_4 etc

4. copy necessary resources and java classes

5. change all references to package name, app name, strings, drawables (eg. launcher icon)
	(in java classes, layout files, manifest file, string file)

6. in some face processing peojects you might add other necessary .jar files eg: 
	- vecmath-1.5.2.jar (for certain geometrical transformations eg. Point2f class)
